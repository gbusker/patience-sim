Patience simulator to test solving strategies

My daughter learnt to play patience and was wondering how often you can actually solve the table.
I thought about it and immediately saw different solving strategies you might follow.  I also wanted to 
try a BDD project and decided to improve my rspec and ruby skills at the same time.

Yes, there are some funny namings and decisions, but hey, it's scratch code and intended to have 99% test 
coverage.
